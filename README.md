# FaT Robo - Peace of Mind, Powered by Technology

FaT Robo is an innovative home security device that provides real-time protection for your home and family. Equipped with IR and flame sensors, green and red LEDs, and a GSM module, FaT Robo is designed to quickly and effectively detect potential threats and alert you.

# Features:- 
IR sensor to detect unauthorized entry 
Flame sensor to detect fire
Green LED to indicate normal status
Red LED to indicate danger
GSM module for real-time alerts
# Usage:- 
If the IR sensor detects an unauthorized entry, it will send a signal to the Arduino board. The board will then turn off the green LED, turn on the red LED and trigger the GSM module, which will send a real-time message to the number you have specified, alerting you to the potential danger.

Similarly, if the flame sensor detects a fire, it will send a signal to the Arduino board. The board will then turn on the red LED and trigger the GSM module, which will send a real-time message to the number you have specified, alerting you to the potential danger.

# Installation:- 
To use FaT Robo, you will need an Arduino board, IR and flame sensors, green and red LEDs, and a GSM module. The steps to set up the device are as follows:

Connect the IR and flame sensors to the Arduino board.
Connect the green and red LEDs to the board.
Connect the GSM module to the board.
Upload the code provided in this repository to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
Configure the GSM module with your SIM card and the desired phone number for receiving alerts.
# Conclusion:- 
FaT Robo is a simple, yet effective solution for keeping your home and family safe. Whether you're at home or away, FaT Robo provides peace of mind and a sense of security that you can count on. So, stay secure and stay connected with FaT Robo!
